  <p>Pabu is a fictional animal known as the fire ferret found in Nickelodeon's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra"><i>The Legend of Korra</i></a>. Creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino modeled Pabu after red pandas. Pabu was saved from a sketchy pet store by Mako and Bolin when they were orphaned children living on the streets. Bolin and Pabu instantly bonded, and have been inseparable ever since. </p>
